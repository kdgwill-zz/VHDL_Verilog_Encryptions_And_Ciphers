Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   15
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:            90 out of   1,920    4%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               710 out of   1,920   36%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            422 out of     960   43%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     422 out of     422 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     422   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         734 out of   1,920   38%

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
