Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   15
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:            94 out of   1,920    4%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               710 out of   1,920   36%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            388 out of     960   40%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     388 out of     388 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     388   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         734 out of   1,920   38%
    Number used as logic:               710
    Number used as a route-thru:         24

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
